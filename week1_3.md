## CAD-Computer Aided Design

Computer-aided design (CAD) is the use of computer programs to create two- or three-dimensional (2D or 3D) graphical representations of physical objects.Computer-aided design (CAD)in the creation, modification, analysis, or optimization of a design,importance of CAD during Fab Academy.
Luciano suggested to use Rhinoceros(for Windows),Rhino can create, edit, analyze, and translate NURBS curves, surfaces, and solids in Windows. There are no limits on complexity, degree, or size.you can also use AutoCad, ProE, Catia v5, SolidWORKS etc.

### Rhinoceros

#### Design using Rhinoceros

This session was completely for Rhinoceros,Luciano taught us before learning individual tools, we will be acquainted with the Rhino interface.He said these following exercises examine the interface elements used in Rhino: the Rhino window, viewports, menus, toolbars, and dialog boxes. He gave a lecture about each and every commands we can use to design and, we got our first assignment using rhinos as well ...

##### list of useful commands:

    Explode
    join
    extrude
    Boolean Difference
    Bounding Box
    sweep1, sweep2
    trim

#### Rhino Assignment-1
 
Draw a Polygon > Create a Bounding Box(for getting the center of polygon) > Draw a line in z axis(start from center)> Draw a Spiral(center) > â€‹Sweep2( make the polygon sweep through both rail)> Boolean Difference( to make hole inside the object)
