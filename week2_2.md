Zeroing Xand Y axis

Fab module window. Used the rml_move tool, change the position of x and y. For generating origin click on 'make rml'.N ext sept was setting up the Z axis manually,the bit close as get to the copper plate but without touching it by keeping the down button pressed. Then loosened the set screws again using Allen key and pushed the bit all the way onto the copper Sheet, then tight the screws again.

now the mechine is all set to milling,next step is loading a png file and start milling.
