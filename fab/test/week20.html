# Final Project Development

For my final project, the problem that we are trying to tackle is being able to Navigate the bild people. Instead of the blind stick and this module will intract , what if we could enable them to move around and interact with environment. The blind will indepentent in his on world...

The blind snooper of this idea is to eventually have it. Why becouse, now a days they seeking help from others. Imagine unpacking a backpack full of these robot modules, and assembling them to perform some task like distributing food through a line faster. Or sorting specific medical supplies to go to one area. Maybe even something as crazy as being able to dig out areas for standing water to flow away from temporary shelter locations.

##What is the Deadline? How much time do you have left?


What tasks have been completed, what tasks remain?
How will you complete the remaining tasks in time?
What has worked?
What hasn&#39;t worked?
What questions still need to be resolved?
What have you learned?
In your Slide Presentation, Have you:
Included your name?
Included the name of your Project?
Included the name of your Project?
Included the name of the Fab Lab
Included the photo/render/sketch of your Project?
Included a brief description of what your Project is/does?
For your Overall Project Deliverables, have you:
Included all your design files in the archive? (No external hosting of final project files, discuss with instructor if needed)
Included a BOM (Billing of Materials) for your Project?
Made a 1-minute video of you explaining your Project?
