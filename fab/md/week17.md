# Week-17 : Applications and Implications



## Assignment


This week's assignment is to propose a final project that integrates the range of units covered below:

*    what will it do?
*    who's done what beforehand?
*    what materials and components will be required?
*    where will they come from?
*    how much will it cost?
*    what parts and systems will be made?
*    what processes will be used?
*    what tasks need to be completed?
*    what questions need to be answered?
*    what is the schedule?
*    how will it be evaluated?

## What will it do...?

a device which sends ultrasonic signals from it and when the signal reflects back, the user gets a tactile (vibratory) feedback on his hands thereby giving him a clear idea about the obstacles on his path. It is a compact device which can be held in the hand and the frequency of the vibration felt on the hand increases as the person comes closer to the obstacle. 

The device can be switched on and off at will and it is so compact that nobody would know that you are walking with the help of a device.



## Who's done what beforehand?

There could be other products on the similar lines. I need to be mindful of this fact and strive to come up with better features to enhance the device further in the future.

I did a thorough research. There are present only the blind stick of the navigation of blind peoples.But the navigation is limited . The distance where the stick reaches they can sense. 

After this presupposition, I tried to do something of different and newest

## What materials and components will be required?

With the research I have done this week I will have to have at least these many items

* PLA
* Plywood
* a controller board with AtTiny 44/atmega 328
* Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR05)
* Vibrating Motor
* Voltage regulator IC 5V
* 2-LED
* 9V battery
* Push button


## Where will they come from?

The components will be sourced mainly from the fablab except Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR05)and Vibrating Motor can be bought from the local electronic component dealers itself.




## How much will it cost?

the entire material cost for the project should be below 500 rupees. The major cost is caused by the microcontroller.


Material:

* Plywood: ~ ₹50 [already available]
*  PLA: ~ ₹50 [already available]

Components:

* Battery: ₹10 [already available]
* Led diode : ₹5 [already available]
* Push Button : ₹10
* Vibrating motor : ₹40
* Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR05: ₹110 




## What parts and systems will be made?

Physical parts:
* Laser cut plywood frame
* 3D printed body

Electronic component:

* Main PCB board
* LED board



## What processes will be used?

I will need to use laser-cutter & 3D printer for making frame and body . Will use the PCB miller for milling the circuit boards. Vinyl cutters for branding by having logos cut out.


## What tasks need to be completed?

Tasks to be completed include milling and programming boards, and a few more...


* 3D modelling and rendering
* Assembly instruction (for avoiding mistakes)
* 2D drawings for laser cutter
* Laser cutting
* 3D printing
* Assembly all parts
* Electronic assembly
* Testing




## What questions need to be answered?

* How to make frequency variation of vibrating motor according to the distance measured.?
* Able to monitor exact distance with an ultrasonic sensor. 
* able to measure 360 degrees?
* 


## What is the schedule?

Design works: 28, 29, 30 of May

Circuit Milling and stuffing: 31st May

Programming the board: 1st June

Computer-Controlled Cutting: 2nd June

Composites: 3rd June

Finishing works and touchups: 4th to 8th June

Documentation works and other remaining works: 9th June to 22nd June


## How will it be evaluated?

I will not have a lot of time. Therefore, I think that I will make a preliminary design evaluation with many manual sketch and rendering. I will take video rendering and assembly instruction to be sure not to make mistakes. Then, I will calculate the kerf with three principal typologies of joints, in this way, I will be able to modify all 2D drawings for the laser cutter.About the electronic components, I will try to use and make the code for the ultrasonic sensor.
