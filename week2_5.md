#### Liquid  Plastic:

 Which perfect for pouring int rubber molds. it turns from a liquid to a solid plastic and reflect perfect detail. whih is ideal for dublicating a varity of original models or patterns.

#### Mold Max 60:

 For high-heat resistance applications and will withstand up to 560°F / 294°C. It features a low mixed viscosity and cured rubber exhibits very low linear shrinkage. Parts A & B are mixed 100A:3B by weight. Pot life is 40 minutes and rubber cures in 24 hours to a relatively hard Shore 60A.Applications include making foundry patterns, flat pattern reproductions and casting low-temperature melt metal alloys such as tin and pewter.
