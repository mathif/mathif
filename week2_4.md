Step 1: Creating the toolpath



Open your 2D design file .DXF fie using the Vcarve Pro software.

Set the Job size of the material based on the available dimensions available on the board you are cutting. The material(Z) thickness is taken as 12mm (depending on the plywood sheet). select the Z Zero on top edge of matirial, Then XY Datucm position seect. Be careful to uncheck the “offset” option.

There are primarily three operations that can be done using the ShopBot: <b> Drilling, pocket and profile </b> Select the drill you use for commen operations or you can use diffrent tool for diffrent operation. So you can adjest the tool propertis speed, depth of cut at each layer, spidile speed etc.

#### Drill

First we start with the Drill operation to mark the holes for the portions which we want to drill screws for the object firmly held in place. Use the circle tool to draw circles of diameter 3mm on opposite sides of each piece of the design.
