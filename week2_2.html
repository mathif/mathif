<div align="justify" style="margin-left:2.5%" style="margin-right:3%">
<p>This machine is used to make PCBs for digital fabrication,this one is compatible with most 3d and 2d authoring software, making it ideal for the rapid prototyping of product designs.It becomes an essential part of Fab lab as it can use to milling of custom circuit boards, and the production of moulds. This Modela can be used on wood, mdf, modeling wax, plaster and FR1 circuit board blanks.</p>

<p>1 .The Green power button, well controls the power.</p>
<p>2 .View, moves the cutting head away and the base plate towards you so that you can place/see your cutting surface.</p>
<p>3 .Tool Up, moves the cutting head up.</p>
<p>4 .Tool Down, moves the cutting head down</p>

<p>First Turned on the Modella Milling Machine. To make it forget its previous <b>Z-zero</b> setting keep Push the both Butten Up and Down up to the Green LED blink into steady. To double check it probably used the view button to take it out of view mode.</p>

<p>Then,slowely slide the bit into the modela. Now with the Allen key, gently tighten the hex-nut to tighten the bit.</p>

<p>Zeroing Xand Y axis</p>
<p>Fab module window. Used the rml_move tool, change the position of x and y. For generating origin click on 'make rml'.N ext sept was setting up the Z axis manually,the bit close as get to the copper plate but without touching it by keeping the down button pressed. Then loosened the set screws again using Allen key and pushed the bit all the way onto the copper Sheet, then tight the screws again.</p>
<p>now the mechine is all set to milling,next step is loading a png file and start milling.</p>
