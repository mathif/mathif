<h2 id="assignment">Assignment :</h2>
<p>This week's assignment is to measure something: add a sensor to a microcontroller board that you have designed and read it.</p>
<p>An input device provides information about a work environment such as magnetic fields, temperature, light, sound, acceleration, orientation, vibration and more ,this information is sensed by a device called sensor and then is processed and measured by a microcontroller.There are hello world example circuits to measure magnetic fields, temperature, light, sound, acceleration, orientation, vibration and more.</p>

<h2 id="making-the-circuit-board">Making the Circuit Board</h2>
<p>I decided to make a the mic circuit.After refering some previous year student's documentations of input devices I decided to redesign Neil's design of mic .Using Eagle, first I drew the schematic and checked the error using ERC.</p>
<p>Then using switch to board option,by arranging and tracing the paths I completed the board.During tracing I needed to change the grid sizes for proper spacing.</p>
<p>Then I milled and stuffed the board with required components.</p>

<p>To program the baard first i had to download hello.mic.45.c ,makefile, hello.mic.45.py,python,I used fabISP to program the board.Connect the board and fabISP together and also with computer.</p>

<p>For compiling program to hex use the following code:</p>
<p><code>sudo make -f hello.mic.45.make</code></p>
<p>code used to program</p>
<p><code>sudo make -f hello.mic.45.make program-usbtiny</code></p>

<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>
<p>I made a four pin ribbon cable and connected it to the board.You need to remove connection to programmer before this.Then I used the example Python program and the FTDI USB to serial cable to communicate with the circuit and display the analog information.To run python program use following code :</p>
<p><code>python hello..mic.45.py /dev/ttyUSB0</code></p>
