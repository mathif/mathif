# Week 5 - 3D Printing & Scanning

</center>

## Assignment


*   Test the limits for your 3D-printer (group project)
*   Design and 3D print an object (small, few cm) that cannot be made subtractively
*   3D scan an object (and optionally print it) (extra credit: make your own scanner)

## Test 3D-Printer Limits

We have an Ultimaker 2 in our FabLab.

In order to test it we looked for test projects on Thingiverse and shortlisted this one, which seems complex enough.

Here is the STL file opened in Cura, which is the software that Ultimaker provides to convert from STL to G-code.

The print took about 1 hr to complete. Here is the finished product:

Here is how Ultimaker performed on all the tests:

<table width="900" border="1">
<tbody><tr>
<td width="500" valign="top"><ul>

<li>size: the object is 4x50x50mm (baseplate)</li> 
<li>hole size: 3 holes</li>
<li>Nut size: M4 Nut should fit perfectly</li>
<li>fine details: pyramide, cone, all numbers</li>
<li>rounded print: wave,h alf sphere</li>
<li>minimum distance between walls: 0.1/0.2/0.3/0.4/0.5mm</li>
<li>overhang: 25°/30°/35°/40°/45°</li>
<li>bridge print: 2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9mm</li>
<li>surface: all the flat parts</li>

## 3D Printing


Using Rhyno I designed a hook for keeping packect items in shelf.

<center><img src="img/w5/1.png" width= "900"/></center>

Then I saved it as .stl format. Here is the STL file opened in Cura, which is the software that Ultimaker provides to convert from STL to G-code.

<center><img src="img/w5/2.png" width= "900"/></center>

First printed a sample product which took the time 25 minte, The design and the dimensions are good, tested and evaluated the output.
Then I made multiple copys of the hook,hanged the stuffs on the shelf using the hook.

You can see what i did....

## 3D Scanning

I used kinect and KScan3D software for scanning.


<center><img src="img/w5/scan/1.png" width= "900"/></center>

saved it in .stl format.

* [3D scan STL file](file/w5/3dscan.stl)
